# ROI-Calc

## Overview 

### This is a Java code that I created as an ROI calculator. It focuses on calculating the Return On Investment for a set of equiment. It employs a LinkedList to manage instances of the Equipment class, which represents specific characteristics like brand, gain, cost, and the computed ROI. The user can input details for three pieces of those characteristics. After that, the program calculates the ROI for each piece and adds them to the LinkedList. It is then generated through the Bubble Sort algorithim to arrange the equipment indescending order based on the ROI.
